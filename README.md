# HoloNotes - holographic note taking

## The idea
Sticky notes, something nearly every person on this planet knows them. These coloured, little peaces of paper that you basically can stick everywhere you like, eg. on your PC or on your fridge. But sometimes, you want to take them with you, but you are too scared to loose them... so you might just take a photo... but what if you already started taking these notes digitally, with your hololens or with your phone and sticked them to a place where you want them to be. So you have them saved on your device or in the cloud and there is no change you loose them if you don't delete them on purpose. That's the basic idea of HoloNotes, a project that wants to combine the standard note taking on sticky notes with the digital world, while still keeping the possibilty to stick them anywhere you want, because they exist in AR.
