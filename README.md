# HoloNotes - Holographic Note Taking

## The Main Idea
Sticky notes - something that nearly every person on this planet is familiar with. And for those who like to organize and plan things, an indispensible tool.

Those coloured, little, pieces of paper that you can stick nearly everywhere you could possibly want to - from the side of your PC, to your fridge, to the bathroom mirror - that are amazing at recording a note in that place.

 But sometimes, you might need to take them with you, but are scared that you might loose them. Amd along with loosing the physical paper, you also would loose the information that is on them. So you you could take a photo... but what if instead of using paper to take a note, you just took them digitally. You could do this with your hololens, or with your phone, and stick them wherever you want, using augmented reality. This way you can now have these notes saved on your device, and even in the cloud - and now there is no way you could loose them... Unless you delete them that is.
 
 That's the basic idea of HoloNotes - a project that wants to combine the standard note taking on sticky notes with the digital world, while still giving the possibility to stick them anywhere you want, because they exist in AR.
